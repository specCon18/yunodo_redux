    Long: `YUNODO redux is a better written version of a tool I wrote for internal use.
This application is a tool that takes comments that start with TODO: and outputs them in a given format.

format for comment is as follows:
    <COMMENT_SYMBOL>TODO: P<PRIORITY_VALUE> <COMMENT>

where COMMENT_SYMBOL is your languages comment symbol,
PRIORITY_VALUE is a priority from 0-9 where 9 is least critical and 0 is needs patched NOW!!!,
and PATH_TO_PROJECT is the path to your codebase's root.

Usage:
    yunodo -p <PATH_TO_PROJECT>
